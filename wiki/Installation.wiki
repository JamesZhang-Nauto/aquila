#summary Installing the library from source.

= Building the library =

You need to have *Qt* installed as the library uses `qmake` as the build system. Then run the following commands:

{{{
svn checkout http://aquila.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ aquila
cd aquila
qmake aquila.pro
make
}}}
(On Windows, replace `make` with `migw32-make`.)

= Installation =

I know, this is the painful part :( Either manually copy header files found in src/ subdirectory and binaries from lib/ subdirectory, or, if you have *Python* installed, use the `install.py` script. Running it may require administrative privileges.

The files `cfg_nt.py` (for Windows) and `cfg_posix.py` (for Linux) can be modified to tell the script where to install the binaries, headers and documentation.
